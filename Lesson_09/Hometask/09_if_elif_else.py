# given values w,x,y,z
# write if-elif-else statement that will search minimum value and print smth aka "'y' is minimum value'
# where 'y' is variable name (not value)
# advice use python debugger and different values to check your algorithm
# optionally you can check your algorithm somehow with assert statements
w, x, y, z = 100, 200, 40, 300
