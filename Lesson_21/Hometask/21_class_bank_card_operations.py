# write class for bank card.
# Class should reflect card lifecycle, card operations etc.
# use CVV, PIN, Name, Surname , end date, card_num as initial params
# class should have in addition to common logic some class attributes, as minimum one classmethod and
# as minimum  one staticmethod, two or more getters/setters, __str_ magic method
# do not forget about block """if __name__ == '__main__':"""  and code there to check your class written logic
